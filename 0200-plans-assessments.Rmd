## Contractor Selection Policy 
 
At New Graph we are responsible to ensure that the contractors we hire 
to complete and assist on projects are compliant with the workers 
compensation act and have a record that illustrates they have a culture 
of safety. For forestry related work that contractors need to be Safe 
Certified companies. We have a checklist that we require our contractors 
to complete to ensure that they meet our requirements. Our policy is to 
always get a clearance letter before and after we receive services from 
a contractor to confirm whether they registered with worksafe BC and 
paying premiums. The contractor selection and safety checklist is 
included as Appendix XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
Of note, contractors are considered our workers if they do not operate 
as an independent business and are either not eligible for WorkSafeBC 
coverage or decline to purchase WorkSafeBC's optional coverage. Below 
are examples of situations where a contractor would likely be our 
worker: 
 
-   The contractor supplies only labour 
 
-   The contractor supplies labour and minor materials 
 
-   The contractor supplies labour and a piece of major equipment but is 
    not registered with WorkSafeBC 
 
## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) policy 
 
All employees will be provided the required PPE when they are hired, and 
instructed on its proper use and care. Employees are responsible for 
keeping PPE in good working condition and notifying their supervisor if 
any PPE no longer meets safe standards. 
 
All PPE must meet regulatory and Canadian Standards Association 
standards. 
 
The following provides a *guideline* to the requirements and use of PPE. 
A full listing of requirements can be found in the Occupational Health 
and Safety Regulation at
