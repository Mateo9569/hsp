"],["covid-19-prevention-and-risks.html", "7 COVID 19 Prevention and Risks", " 7 COVID 19 Prevention and Risks We have developed a COVID-19 Safety Plan that outlines the policies, guidelines, and procedures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. All staff, contractors, volunteers, and participants must complete a self-assessment (https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en) before starting work each day. If they are experiencing any symptoms related to COVID-19 they must halt all involvement or participation, notify the project supervisor, and get officially tested. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads in several ways, including through droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or from touching a contaminated surface before touching the face. Planning to COVID-19 is a moving target and should be a continuous effort. Planning is outlined by WCB (https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operation). Detailed procedures are included in the safe work procedures in the Appendices of this document and were developed by progressing through the following steps: Assess the risk at your workplace to identify places where the risk of transmission is introduced What job tasks or processes require workers to come into close proximity with one another or members of the public? What tools, machinery, and equipment do people come into contact with in the course of their work? What surfaces are touched often, such as doorknobs, light switches, equipment, and shared tools? Implement measures to reduce the risk Maintain a distance of 2 metres (6 feet) between workers and others wherever possible create pods of workers who work together exclusively to minimize the risk of broad transmission throughout the workplace where physical distance cannot be maintained consider the use of masks. Provide adequate hand-washing facilities on site for all workers Develop policies around when workers must wash their hands, including upon arriving for work, before and after breaks and before and after handling common tools and equipment. Implement a cleaning protocol for all common areas and surfaces, including washrooms, equipment, tools, common tables, desks, light switches, and door handles. Ensure those engaged in cleaning have adequate training and materials. Remove any unnecessary tools or equipment that may elevate the risk of transmission. Develop policies to manage the workplace Anyone who has had symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 10 days must self-isolate at home. Anyone under the direction of the provincial health officer to self-isolate must follow those instructions When workers or contractors are feeling ill at work they should immediately let their supervisor know and go home. If symptoms align with those of COVID-19 they should be tested and self-isolate until they are symptom free and have a negative test result.

Use a Vehicle Pre-trip Inspection and Mileage Log to track activity. Report deficiencies and do not use if equipment is in unsafe condition. Make notes of required maintenance in the mileage logbook when it is required and include “checking the logbook for required repairs” at the time of each inspection. Drive defensively at all times. Ensure all vehicle occupants are wearing seatbelts. You are responsible for your passengers. Do not exceed posted speed limits. On resource roads do not exceed 80kph or posted speed limits. Drive safely and drive to the existing road conditions. Lower speed as required. Be aware of: Visibility reduced by dust, fog, rain and snow; Narrow roads with over width vehicles; Steep favorable and adverse gradients; Slippery and variable road surface conditions due to loose gravel, snow, ice or mud; Other users. Use vehicle for intended use only (purpose and weight limitations). Drive with vehicle lights on at all times. Secure all heavy or sharp objects in the cab of the vehicle. Respect that loaded logging trucks have the right of way on single lane roads. Do not tailgate other vehicles. Pass trucks or equipment only after you receive a clearly visible and/or audible signal from the operator. Never chase a runaway vehicle. Stay on your side of the road. COVID 19 (COVID) Self-assess daily for COVID symptoms and self-isolate and test if you have symptoms. When possible, travel in separate vehicles. When a crew is required to travel together, sit in seats as far from eachother as possible, wear masks and when possible leave the windows open for good ventilation. All vehicles need to have paper towel, min 70% alcohol hand sanitizer and non-medical grade masks. Ensure this is present before leaving. When getting in vehicle wipe down all initial touch points with min 70% alcohol and paper towel (ex. Vehicle door, radio, steering wheel, shifter, seat belt). Sanitize all surfaces of both hands. After opening vehicle door at all stops and worksites use hand sanitizer on surfaces of both hands. Put on non-medical mask if entering building (ex. Gas station, restaurants) or working with others where you cannot keep min 2m distance. Upon exiting vehicle close door with elbow. 17.1.2 RADIO USE: Complete radio check and ensure correct frequency prior to entering radio controlled area. Do not drive by the radio. Expect oncoming traffic at all times. Call your position according to the local radio protocol and signage. Notify other radio equipped vehicles of oncoming non-radio equipped traffic. Do not use road radio channels for conversations, use only for road traffic protocols. Other than traffic control, pull over and safely park when talking on the radio/cell phone for an extended period of time. 17.1.3 PARKING: Park clear of traffic, away from active areas in pullouts or extra wide straight sections of road. Park facing the direction of exit with access for service/towing activities. Ensure the parking brake is on and the transmission is in 1st gear or park. On steep grades, use wheel chocks and always turn the wheels towards the nearest ditch. Never park on a curve especially on the outside curve of a road. When turning around, back into the cut bank of the road and not towards the outside bank. Use flares where required. 17.2 All-terrain vehicles 17.3 Electrofishing 17.3.1 Preparatory Procedures A crew leader must be designated for all backpack electrofishing activities. It is the crew leader’s responsibility to ensure that all equipment is in “safe working order”. An emergency response plan must be prepared and reviewed with all crew members. The crew leader must ensure all crew members have received instruction in the fundamentals of electrofishing safety. The crew leader and at least one additional crew member must have up-to-date CPR and First Aid training. Each electrofishing site must be visually inspected for hazards such as deep holes, submerged logs, etc. before commencing electrofishing operations. In order to aid in identifying underwater hazards, all crew members must be equipped with polarized sunglasses. Glasses also protect against eye injury caused by sticks and branches. Wide brimmed hats or peaked caps are also beneficial in increasing the effectiveness of polarized glasses. All crew members must be equipped with long armed gloves that are non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Gloves must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations. All crew members must be equipped with chest waders that are non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Chest waders must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations by team members entering the water. Wading belts are to be worn at all times. All crew members must agree on a system of communication during electrofishing operations. Backpack electrofishing units must be turned off and the battery disconnected before making any connections or part replacements. Start-up Procedures All crew members must be notified and acknowledge their preparedness prior to the commencement of electrofishing operations. The unit operator must make sure that personnel are clear of the anode before turning on the power. Hand signals are a useful way of conveying these messages. Check operation of all switches and gauges. This should include high voltage check, anode switch, power switch and mercury tilt switch, audible tone generator and light. Set controls to appropriate levels. The minimum voltage possible to obtain the desired results should be used to avoid excessive harm to the biota and to minimize the effects of accidental shock. 17.3.2 Operational Procedures Operate slowly and carefully. Footing in most streams is poor and most falls occur when crew members are hurrying. Operations should cease when fatigue sets in. Team members must not place their hand(s) into the water when the power is turned on. Electrofishing units must be shut off prior to entering or leaving the water and the battery terminals disconnected (or generator shut off) when not in use or when transporting the unit. Life jackets or Personal Floatation Devices (PFDs) must be worn where the crew leader considers the water is of sufficient depth or velocity for a life jacket or PFD to be effective as protection from risk of drowning. Life jackets and PFDs must be approved by Transport Canada or Canadian Coast Guard. Electrofishing should not be carried out where water depth is greater than waist deep. A crew member must immediately leave the water if wetness is detected in gloves or waders (by leaks, rain or perspiration) and obtain dry equipment before returning. Mild dampness from perspiration or humidity is considered normal. Electrofishing operations must cease during inclement weather. (e.g.  periods of any lightning or moderate rain). COVID 19 As electrofishing often requires the “fisher” and “netter” to be within 2m of eachother masks are required to be worn by both crew members. Wear disposable gloves when assembling equipment or wipe down all touch points after assembly. 17.4 17.5 Boats 17.6 17.7 Culvert Assessments and habitat confirmation assessments See driving procedures including radio use and parking. Sometime parking on the shoulder of resource roads is the only practical way to assess a site. When doing so place a traffic cone 2m behind the back left wheel to alert oncoming traffic. Wear waders and wading boots or a non-slip rubber boot when working in the stream. Carefully assess your footing and be ready for slippery surfaces. Carry bear spray Always carry personal first aid kit, water, extra clothes, inreach and food (ex. Power bar) in your vest in case of an emergency. High vis field vest should be worn to avoid being mistaken for an animal by hunters. Navigating to sites requires handheld devices which should either be used by a non-driving crew member or mounted on the windshield where they can be viewed without distracting the driver. Touching base with the call in person throughout the day is essential so that your last known location is known and to minimize the potential for false alarms should you not check in on time at the end of the day. Inreaches should be tested between crew members and between crew members and check in people before going in the field. 17.8 Bears Situation Recommended actions Bear does not know you are there Move away undetected.  Go back the way you came or take large detour around. If you must go ahead do so slowly and cautiously. DO NOT RUN Keep your eye on the bear. Watch for changes in behavior. Be careful not to crowd or surprise bear (especially Grizzlies).  Do not shout if it is unaware of your presence. Bear becomes aware of you Calmly and from as far away as possible identify yourself as human. Talk to the bear in a low, respectful voice. Wave your arms slowly. Increase the distance between you and the bear. If possible, move upwind to give the bear your scent. When bear is aware and unconcerned take the opportunity to leave. Do not run. If you hear bear vocalizations or see young bears in area Be extremely cautious and leave the area the way you came. If bear approaches you Stop, stay calm, and assess the situation: is bear acting defensively (grunting, or another way? Don’t run. Group together if possible.  Prepare deterrent (mace). Determine if bear is defensive or aggressive. Bear approaching in a defensive (stressed) manner Defensive bears are threatened or may be protecting food. They show stressed behaviour such as rapid huffing, salivating, roaring, paw slapping, guttural noises, open mouthed jawing and charging. When bear approaches or charges stand your ground (physical contact is rare). Most charges stop short. Appear non-threatening.  Talk to bear in calm voice and let it know you mean it no harm. Don’t shout or throw things acting defensively.  Try to increase distance between you and the bear (keep your eye on it).  Do not run. Use deterrent only as last defense. In the case of a defensive attack If bear physically contacts you in a defensive attack play dead: fall on ground on your front, protect your neck.  If rolled over continue to roll over to face.  Stay on ground till bear leaves.  If attach is prolonged it is no longer defensive. Bear approaching in non-defensive manner Non defensive bears show little stress. They look interested in you and intent on approaching you. Watch towards you confidently looking towards you intermittently. They seem intent on attack. If approached move away from bears path or trail.  If bear is intent on you stand your ground. Your response needs to be assertive.
