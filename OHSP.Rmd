# Safety Policy 
 
At New Graph Environment we believe that all injuries are preventable 
and that safety is the responsibility of everyone. We believe that 
getting hurt at work is not acceptable and that by building a culture of 
safety we: 
 
-   will look ahead to identify hazards, 
 
-   will document safety procedures and ensure that our management, 
    staff and contractors are familiar with them and understand why we 
    have them, 
 
-   will strive for continuous improvement to ensure that we learn from 
    the past and look to the future to facilitate the safest working 
    environment possible for ourselves, our contractors, our clients and 
    the public.

## Safety Team Members 
 
As a small company all management and staff are considered safety team 
members and expected to integral to the safety program. Feedback is 
encouraged as continual improvement is a paramount goal. 
 
## Job Roles and Responsibilities 
 
### Right to refuse work and report unsafe conditions {#right-to-refuse-work-and-report-unsafe-conditions .Style1} 
 
If you feel the work as planned is unsafe, refuse to do it! Let's 
identify the hazards and mitigate for them or we will not do the work. 
This is work and it is not worth it to risk life and limb. 
 
## COVID 19 Prevention and Risks 
 
We have developed a COVID-19 Safety Plan that outlines the policies, 
guidelines, and procedures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. 
 
All staff, contractors, volunteers, and participants must complete a 
self-assessment (<https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en>) before starting 
work each day. If they are experiencing any symptoms related to COVID-19 
they must halt all involvement or participation, notify the project 
supervisor, and get officially tested. 
 
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads in several ways, including 
through droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or from touching a 
contaminated surface before touching the face. Planning to COVID-19 is a 
moving target and should be a continuous effort. Planning is outlined by 
WCB 
(<https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operation>). 
Detailed procedures are included in the safe work procedures in the 
Appendices of this document and were developed by progressing through 
the following steps: 
 
1.  Assess the risk at your workplace to identify places where the risk 
    of transmission is introduced 
 
    a.  What job tasks or processes require workers to come into close 
        proximity with one another or members of the public? 
 
    b.  What tools, machinery, and equipment do people come into contact 
        with in the course of their work? 
 
    c.  What surfaces are touched often, such as doorknobs, light 
        switches, equipment, and shared tools? 
 
2.  Implement measures to reduce the risk 
 
    a.  Maintain a distance of 2 metres (6 feet) between workers and 
        others wherever possible 
 
    b.  create pods of workers who work together exclusively to minimize 
        the risk of broad transmission throughout the workplace 
 
    c.  where physical distance cannot be maintained consider the use of 
        masks. 
 
    d.  Provide adequate hand-washing facilities on site for all workers 
 
    e.  Develop policies around when workers must wash their hands, 
        including upon arriving for work, before and after breaks and 
        before and after handling common tools and equipment. 
 
    f.  Implement a cleaning protocol for all common areas and surfaces, 
        including washrooms, equipment, tools, common tables, desks, 
        light switches, and door handles. Ensure those engaged in 
        cleaning have adequate training and materials. 
 
    g.  Remove any unnecessary tools or equipment that may elevate the 
        risk of transmission. 
 
3.  Develop policies to manage the workplace 
 
    a.  Anyone who has had [symptoms of 
        COVID-19](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms) 
        in the last 10 days must self-isolate at home. 
 
    b.  Anyone under the direction of the provincial health officer to 
        self-isolate must follow those instructions 
 
    c.  When workers or contractors are feeling ill at work they should 
        immediately let their supervisor know and go home. If symptoms 
        align with those of COVID-19 they should be tested and 
        self-isolate until they are symptom free and have a negative 
        test result. 
 
## Required safety meetings 
 
### New Worker Orientations  {#new-worker-orientations .Style1} 
 
New workers are a high risk for injuries. They need to know the safety 
policies and procedures and demonstrate that they understand how to 
protect themselves and others. All employees and dependent contractors 
operating under your company's safety plan must review the New Graph 
health and safety policies and safe work procedures on their first day 
before they start work or when returning to work after an absence of 
longer than 6 weeks. Template to be filled out is attached as Appendix 
1. 
 
### Tailboards (Site and Worker Assessment / Equipment and Vehicle Inspection / Emergency Contact List) {#tailboards-site-and-worker-assessment-equipment-and-vehicle-inspection-emergency-contact-list .Style1} 
 
Tailboard meetings are a way to reset at the start of new work tasks to  put safety first as the top priority at all places of work. Our tailboard template is unique in that it contains places for documentation of numerous safety policy actions in one place. Tailboards include references to field safety plans and contain:

  * site assessments
  * Worker Assessments
  * Equipment and Vehicle Inspections 
  * Emergency Contact List
  * Hazard inspections
  * Add more here
  
They are included in this plan as **Appendix 2** 
 
## First Aid equipment and procedures 

A level 1 kit is kept under the seat of each work vehicle and our OHSP in also kept in the truck. The kit should be inspected for contents to see that it is complete. Below is an itemized list of what should be in the kit:


    * Find a refrence online to what is in this kit and put here.
 
### Worksite First Aid Requirements {#worksite-first-aid-requirements .Style1} 
 
To determine an adequate and appropriate level of first aid coverage, 
the first step is a first aid assessment. This doesn\'t need to be 
complicated. But it does call for a full review of your workplace. The 
assessment will help you determine the minimum level of first aid needed 
in your workplace. First aid levels are outlined in the [OHS Regulation 
Schedule 3-A: Minimum Levels of First 
Aid](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/law-policy/occupational-health-safety/searchable-ohs-regulation/ohs-regulation/part-03-rights-and-responsibilities#Schedule3A). 
 
Below are the steps for a first aid assessment. Tables of scenarios 
based on the number of people working and the assessed hazard rating are 
included in Appendix 4. 
 
-   Identify the number of workplaces. 
 
-   Identify your workplace hazard rating. 
 
-   Consider the surface travel time to a hospital. 
 
-   Determine the number of workers on a shift. 
 
-   Determine the required first aid services for your workplace. 
 
-   Review your assessment.

# Plans and Assessments

## Field Safety Plans {#field-safety-plans .Style1} 
 
### Check-in procedures and field communications  
 
## Hazard / close-call / incident reporting requirements and procedures {#hazard-close-call-incident-reporting-requirements-and-procedures .Style1} 

Close calls are opportunities to prevent incidents in the future.  For this reason we have policies in place that we document them and review them. Close-call reporting templates are provided as an appendix and are required when:

    * there is a near miss for an injury
    * equipment is almost damaged
    
 
## Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and procedures {#emergency-response-plan-erp-and-procedures .Style1} 



###  Vehicle and Machinery Inspections  

If your wheel falls off your truck you can get hurt or hurt someone else. 
This is an example of why we inspect our equipment, record issues and act to ensure everything is in working order. Included in our tailboard templat
 
###  Site and Worker Assessments  

As an employer, we should conduct a systematic risk assessment to help us identify the hazards that exist in your workplace, and how they may put your workers at risk. To determine if we've done enough to protect our workers, we use a rating system as part of your risk assessment.

##  Contractor Selection Policy 
 
At New Graph we are responsible to ensure that the contractors we hire 
to complete and assist on projects are compliant with the workers 
compensation act and have a record that illustrates they have a culture 
of safety. For forestry related work that contractors need to be Safe 
Certified companies. We have a checklist that we require our contractors 
to complete to ensure that they meet our requirements. Our policy is to 
always get a clearance letter before and after we receive services from 
a contractor to confirm whether they registered with worksafe BC and 
paying premiums. The contractor selection and safety checklist is 
included as Appendix XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
Of note, contractors are considered our workers if they do not operate 
as an independent business and are either not eligible for WorkSafeBC 
coverage or decline to purchase WorkSafeBC's optional coverage. Below 
are examples of situations where a contractor would likely be our 
worker: 
 
-   The contractor supplies only labour 
 
-   The contractor supplies labour and minor materials 
 
-   The contractor supplies labour and a piece of major equipment but is 
    not registered with WorkSafeBC 
 
## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) policy 
 
All employees will be provided the required PPE when they are hired, and 
instructed on its proper use and care. Employees are responsible for 
keeping PPE in good working condition and notifying their supervisor if 
any PPE no longer meets safe standards. 
 
All PPE must meet regulatory and Canadian Standards Association 
standards. 
 
The following provides a *guideline* to the requirements and use of PPE. 
A full listing of requirements can be found in the Occupational Health 
and Safety Regulation at 
<https://www.worksafebc.com/en/law-policy/occupational-health-safety/searchable-ohs-regulation/ohs-regulation/part-08-personal-protective-clothing-and-equipment>

# Safe Work Procedures 
 
## Driving {#driving .Style1} 
 
### PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES: 
 
-   Conduct a "pre-trip" vehicle check. Use a Vehicle Pre-trip 
    Inspection and Mileage Log to track activity. 
 
-   Report deficiencies and do not use if equipment is in unsafe 
    condition. 
 
-   Make notes of required maintenance in the mileage logbook when it is 
    required and include "checking the logbook for required repairs" at 
    the time of each inspection. 
 
-   Drive defensively at all times. 
 
-   Ensure all vehicle occupants are wearing seatbelts. You are 
    responsible for your passengers. 
 
-   Do not exceed posted speed limits. 
 
-   On resource roads do not exceed 80kph or posted speed limits. 
 
-   Drive safely and drive to the existing road conditions. Lower speed 
    as required. Be aware of: 
 
    -   Visibility reduced by dust, fog, rain and snow; 
 
    -   Narrow roads with over width vehicles; 
 
    -   Steep favorable and adverse gradients; 
 
    -   Slippery and variable road surface conditions due to loose 
        gravel, snow, ice or mud; 
 
    -   Other users. 
 
-   Use vehicle for intended use only (purpose and weight limitations). 
 
-   Drive with vehicle lights on at all times. 
 
-   Secure all heavy or sharp objects in the cab of the vehicle. 
 
-   Respect that loaded logging trucks have the right of way on single 
    lane roads. 
 
-   Do not tailgate other vehicles. 
 
-   Pass trucks or equipment only after you receive a clearly visible 
    and/or audible signal from the operator. 
 
-   Never chase a runaway vehicle. 
 
-   Stay on your side of the road. 
 
    **COVID 19 (COVID)** 
 
    -   [Self-assess daily for COVID 
        symptoms](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en) and self-isolate 
        and test if you have symptoms. 
 
    -   When possible, travel in separate vehicles. When a crew is 
        required to travel together, sit in seats as far from eachother 
        as possible, wear masks and when possible leave the windows open 
        for good ventilation. 
 
    -   All vehicles need to have paper towel, min 70% alcohol hand 
        sanitizer and non-medical grade masks. Ensure this is present 
        before leaving. 
 
    -   When getting in vehicle wipe down all initial touch points with 
        min 70% alcohol and paper towel (ex. Vehicle door, radio, 
        steering wheel, shifter, seat belt). Sanitize all surfaces of 
        both hands. 
 
    -   After opening vehicle door at all stops and worksites use hand 
        sanitizer on surfaces of both hands. Put on non-medical mask if 
        entering building (ex. Gas station, restaurants) or working with 
        others where you cannot keep min 2m distance. Upon exiting 
        vehicle close door with elbow. 
 
### RADIO USE: 
 
-   Complete radio check and ensure correct frequency prior to entering 
    radio controlled area. 
 
-   Do not drive by the radio. Expect oncoming traffic at all times. 
 
-   Call your position according to the local radio protocol and 
    signage. 
 
-   Notify other radio equipped vehicles of oncoming non-radio equipped 
    traffic. 
 
-   Do not use road radio channels for conversations, use only for road 
    traffic protocols. 
 
-   Other than traffic control, pull over and safely park when talking 
    on the radio/cell phone for an extended period of time. 
 
### PARKING: 
 
-   Park clear of traffic, away from active areas in pullouts or extra 
    wide straight sections of road. 
 
-   Park facing the direction of exit with access for service/towing 
    activities. 
 
-   Ensure the parking brake is on and the transmission is in 1st gear 
    or park. 
 
-   On steep grades, use wheel chocks and always turn the wheels towards 
    the nearest ditch. 
 
-   Never park on a curve especially on the outside curve of a road. 
 
-   When turning around, back into the cut bank of the road and not 
    towards the outside bank. 
 
-   Use flares where required.

## Electrofishing {#electrofishing .Style1} 
 
### Preparatory Procedures  
 
1.  A crew leader must be designated for all backpack electrofishing 
    activities. 
 
2.  It is the crew leader's responsibility to ensure that all equipment 
    is in "safe working order". 
 
3.  An emergency response plan must be prepared and reviewed with all 
    crew members. 
 
4.  The crew leader must ensure all crew members have received 
    instruction in the fundamentals of electrofishing safety. 
 
5.  The crew leader and at least one additional crew member must have 
    up-to-date CPR and First Aid training. 
 
6.  Each electrofishing site must be visually inspected for hazards such 
    as deep holes, submerged logs, etc. before commencing electrofishing 
    operations. 
 
7.  In order to aid in identifying underwater hazards, all crew members 
    must be equipped with polarized sunglasses. Glasses also protect 
    against eye injury caused by sticks and branches. Wide brimmed hats 
    or peaked caps are also beneficial in increasing the effectiveness 
    of polarized glasses. 
 
8.  All crew members must be equipped with long armed gloves that are 
    non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Gloves 
    must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations. 
 
9.  All crew members must be equipped with chest waders that are 
    non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Chest 
    waders must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations by 
    team members entering the water. Wading belts are to be worn at all 
    times. 
 
10. All crew members must agree on a system of communication during 
    electrofishing operations. 
 
11. Backpack electrofishing units must be turned off and the battery 
    disconnected before making any connections or part replacements. 
    Start-up Procedures 
 
12. All crew members must be notified and acknowledge their preparedness 
    prior to the commencement of electrofishing operations. The unit 
    operator must make sure that personnel are clear of the anode before 
    turning on the power. Hand signals are a useful way of conveying 
    these messages. 
 
13. Check operation of all switches and gauges. This should include high 
    voltage check, anode switch, power switch and mercury tilt switch, 
    audible tone generator and light. Set controls to appropriate 
    levels. The minimum voltage possible to obtain the desired results 
    should be used to avoid excessive harm to the biota and to minimize 
    the effects of accidental shock. 
 
### Operational Procedures  
 
14. Operate slowly and carefully. Footing in most streams is poor and 
    most falls occur when crew members are hurrying. Operations should 
    cease when fatigue sets in. 
 
15. Team members must not place their hand(s) into the water when the 
    power is turned on. 
 
16. Electrofishing units must be shut off prior to entering or leaving 
    the water and the battery terminals disconnected (or generator shut 
    off) when not in use or when transporting the unit. 
 
17. Life jackets or Personal Floatation Devices (PFDs) must be worn 
    where the crew leader considers the water is of sufficient depth or 
    velocity for a life jacket or PFD to be effective as protection from 
    risk of drowning. Life jackets and PFDs must be approved by 
    Transport Canada or Canadian Coast Guard. Electrofishing should not 
    be carried out where water depth is greater than waist deep. 
 
18. A crew member must immediately leave the water if wetness is 
    detected in gloves or waders (by leaks, rain or perspiration) and 
    obtain dry equipment before returning. Mild dampness from 
    perspiration or humidity is considered normal. 
 
19. Electrofishing operations must cease during inclement weather. (e.g. 
    periods of any lightning or moderate rain). 
 
**COVID 19** 
 
-   As electrofishing often requires the "fisher" and "netter" to be 
    within 2m of eachother masks are required to be worn by both crew 
    members. 
 
-   Wear disposable gloves when assembling equipment or wipe down all 
    touch points after assembly. 
 

# Boats {#boats .Style1} 
 
# Culvert Assessments and habitat confirmation assessments {#culvert-assessments-and-habitat-confirmation-assessments .Style1} 
 
See driving procedures including radio use and parking. 
 
-   Sometime parking on the shoulder of resource roads is the only 
    practical way to assess a site. When doing so place a traffic cone 
    2m behind the back left wheel to alert oncoming traffic. 
 
-   Wear waders and wading boots or a non-slip rubber boot when working 
    in the stream. Carefully assess your footing and be ready for 
    slippery surfaces. 
 
-   Carry bear spray 
 
-   Always carry personal first aid kit, water, extra clothes, inreach 
    and food (ex. Power bar) in your vest in case of an emergency. 
 
-   High vis field vest should be worn to avoid being mistaken for an 
    animal by hunters. 
 
-   Navigating to sites requires handheld devices which should either be 
    used by a non-driving crew member or mounted on the windshield where 
    they can be viewed without distracting the driver. 
 
-   Touching base with the call in person throughout the day is 
    essential so that your last known location is known and to minimize 
    the potential for false alarms should you not check in on time at 
    the end of the day. Inreaches should be tested between crew members 
    and between crew members and check in people before going in the 
    field. 
 
# Bears {#bears .Style1}

|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Be careful not to crowd or surprise bear       | 
|                     | (especially Grizzlies).  Do not shout if it is | 
|                     | unaware of your presence.                      | 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
