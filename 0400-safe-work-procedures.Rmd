# Safe Work Procedures 
 
## Driving {#driving .Style1} 
 
### PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES: 
 
-   Conduct a "pre-trip" vehicle check. Use a Vehicle Pre-trip 
    Inspection and Mileage Log to track activity. 
 
-   Report deficiencies and do not use if equipment is in unsafe 
    condition. 
 
-   Make notes of required maintenance in the mileage logbook when it is 
    required and include "checking the logbook for required repairs" at 
    the time of each inspection. 
 
-   Drive defensively at all times. 
 
-   Ensure all vehicle occupants are wearing seatbelts. You are 
    responsible for your passengers. 
 
-   Do not exceed posted speed limits. 
 
-   On resource roads do not exceed 80kph or posted speed limits. 
 
-   Drive safely and drive to the existing road conditions. Lower speed 
    as required. Be aware of: 
 
    -   Visibility reduced by dust, fog, rain and snow; 
 
    -   Narrow roads with over width vehicles; 
 
    -   Steep favorable and adverse gradients; 
 
    -   Slippery and variable road surface conditions due to loose 
        gravel, snow, ice or mud; 
 
    -   Other users. 
 
-   Use vehicle for intended use only (purpose and weight limitations). 
 
-   Drive with vehicle lights on at all times. 
 
-   Secure all heavy or sharp objects in the cab of the vehicle. 
 
-   Respect that loaded logging trucks have the right of way on single 
    lane roads. 
 
-   Do not tailgate other vehicles. 
 
-   Pass trucks or equipment only after you receive a clearly visible 
    and/or audible signal from the operator. 
 
-   Never chase a runaway vehicle. 
 
-   Stay on your side of the road. 
 
    **COVID 19 (COVID)** 
 
    -   [Self-assess daily for COVID 
        symptoms](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en) and self-isolate 
        and test if you have symptoms. 
 
    -   When possible, travel in separate vehicles. When a crew is 
        required to travel together, sit in seats as far from eachother 
        as possible, wear masks and when possible leave the windows open 
        for good ventilation. 
 
    -   All vehicles need to have paper towel, min 70% alcohol hand 
        sanitizer and non-medical grade masks. Ensure this is present 
        before leaving. 
 
    -   When getting in vehicle wipe down all initial touch points with 
        min 70% alcohol and paper towel (ex. Vehicle door, radio, 
        steering wheel, shifter, seat belt). Sanitize all surfaces of 
        both hands. 
 
    -   After opening vehicle door at all stops and worksites use hand 
        sanitizer on surfaces of both hands. Put on non-medical mask if 
        entering building (ex. Gas station, restaurants) or working with 
        others where you cannot keep min 2m distance. Upon exiting 
        vehicle close door with elbow. 
 
### RADIO USE: 
 
-   Complete radio check and ensure correct frequency prior to entering 
    radio controlled area. 
 
-   Do not drive by the radio. Expect oncoming traffic at all times. 
 
-   Call your position according to the local radio protocol and 
    signage. 
 
-   Notify other radio equipped vehicles of oncoming non-radio equipped 
    traffic. 
 
-   Do not use road radio channels for conversations, use only for road 
    traffic protocols. 
 
-   Other than traffic control, pull over and safely park when talking 
    on the radio/cell phone for an extended period of time. 
 
### PARKING: 
 
-   Park clear of traffic, away from active areas in pullouts or extra 
    wide straight sections of road. 
 
-   Park facing the direction of exit with access for service/towing 
    activities. 
 
-   Ensure the parking brake is on and the transmission is in 1st gear 
    or park. 
 
-   On steep grades, use wheel chocks and always turn the wheels towards 
    the nearest ditch. 
 
-   Never park on a curve especially on the outside curve of a road. 
 
-   When turning around, back into the cut bank of the road and not 
    towards the outside bank. 
 
-   Use flares where required.

## Electrofishing {#electrofishing .Style1} 
 
### Preparatory Procedures  
 
1.  A crew leader must be designated for all backpack electrofishing 
    activities. 
 
2.  It is the crew leader's responsibility to ensure that all equipment 
    is in "safe working order". 
 
3.  An emergency response plan must be prepared and reviewed with all 
    crew members. 
 
4.  The crew leader must ensure all crew members have received 
    instruction in the fundamentals of electrofishing safety. 
 
5.  The crew leader and at least one additional crew member must have 
    up-to-date CPR and First Aid training. 
 
6.  Each electrofishing site must be visually inspected for hazards such 
    as deep holes, submerged logs, etc. before commencing electrofishing 
    operations. 
 
7.  In order to aid in identifying underwater hazards, all crew members 
    must be equipped with polarized sunglasses. Glasses also protect 
    against eye injury caused by sticks and branches. Wide brimmed hats 
    or peaked caps are also beneficial in increasing the effectiveness 
    of polarized glasses. 
 
8.  All crew members must be equipped with long armed gloves that are 
    non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Gloves 
    must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations. 
 
9.  All crew members must be equipped with chest waders that are 
    non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Chest 
    waders must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations by 
    team members entering the water. Wading belts are to be worn at all 
    times. 
 
10. All crew members must agree on a system of communication during 
    electrofishing operations. 
 
11. Backpack electrofishing units must be turned off and the battery 
    disconnected before making any connections or part replacements. 
    Start-up Procedures 
 
12. All crew members must be notified and acknowledge their preparedness 
    prior to the commencement of electrofishing operations. The unit 
    operator must make sure that personnel are clear of the anode before 
    turning on the power. Hand signals are a useful way of conveying 
    these messages. 
 
13. Check operation of all switches and gauges. This should include high 
    voltage check, anode switch, power switch and mercury tilt switch, 
    audible tone generator and light. Set controls to appropriate 
    levels. The minimum voltage possible to obtain the desired results 
    should be used to avoid excessive harm to the biota and to minimize 
    the effects of accidental shock. 
 
### Operational Procedures  
 
14. Operate slowly and carefully. Footing in most streams is poor and 
    most falls occur when crew members are hurrying. Operations should 
    cease when fatigue sets in. 
 
15. Team members must not place their hand(s) into the water when the 
    power is turned on. 
 
16. Electrofishing units must be shut off prior to entering or leaving 
    the water and the battery terminals disconnected (or generator shut 
    off) when not in use or when transporting the unit. 
 
17. Life jackets or Personal Floatation Devices (PFDs) must be worn 
    where the crew leader considers the water is of sufficient depth or 
    velocity for a life jacket or PFD to be effective as protection from 
    risk of drowning. Life jackets and PFDs must be approved by 
    Transport Canada or Canadian Coast Guard. Electrofishing should not 
    be carried out where water depth is greater than waist deep. 
 
18. A crew member must immediately leave the water if wetness is 
    detected in gloves or waders (by leaks, rain or perspiration) and 
    obtain dry equipment before returning. Mild dampness from 
    perspiration or humidity is considered normal. 
 
19. Electrofishing operations must cease during inclement weather. (e.g. 
    periods of any lightning or moderate rain). 
 
**COVID 19** 
 
-   As electrofishing often requires the "fisher" and "netter" to be 
    within 2m of eachother masks are required to be worn by both crew 
    members. 
 
-   Wear disposable gloves when assembling equipment or wipe down all 
    touch points after assembly. 
 

# Boats {#boats .Style1} 
 
# Culvert Assessments and habitat confirmation assessments {#culvert-assessments-and-habitat-confirmation-assessments .Style1} 
 
See driving procedures including radio use and parking. 
 
-   Sometime parking on the shoulder of resource roads is the only 
    practical way to assess a site. When doing so place a traffic cone 
    2m behind the back left wheel to alert oncoming traffic. 
 
-   Wear waders and wading boots or a non-slip rubber boot when working 
    in the stream. Carefully assess your footing and be ready for 
    slippery surfaces. 
 
-   Carry bear spray 
 
-   Always carry personal first aid kit, water, extra clothes, inreach 
    and food (ex. Power bar) in your vest in case of an emergency. 
 
-   High vis field vest should be worn to avoid being mistaken for an 
    animal by hunters. 
 
-   Navigating to sites requires handheld devices which should either be 
    used by a non-driving crew member or mounted on the windshield where 
    they can be viewed without distracting the driver. 
 
-   Touching base with the call in person throughout the day is 
    essential so that your last known location is known and to minimize 
    the potential for false alarms should you not check in on time at 
    the end of the day. Inreaches should be tested between crew members 
    and between crew members and check in people before going in the 
    field. 
 
# Bears {#bears .Style1} 
 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+ 
| **Situation**       | **Recommended actions**                        | 
+=====================+================================================+ 
| Bear does not know  | Move away undetected.  Go back the way you     | 
| you are there       | came or take large detour around. If you must  | 
|                     | go ahead do so slowly and cautiously. DO NOT   | 
|                     | RUN                                            | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Keep your eye on the bear.                     | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Watch for changes in behavior.                 | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Be careful not to crowd or surprise bear       | 
|                     | (especially Grizzlies).  Do not shout if it is | 
|                     | unaware of your presence.                      | 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+ 
| Bear becomes aware  | Calmly and from as far away as possible        | 
| of you              | identify yourself as human.                    | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Talk to the bear in a low, respectful voice.   | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Wave your arms slowly.                         | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Increase the distance between you and the      | 
|                     | bear.                                          | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | If possible, move upwind to give the bear your | 
|                     | scent.                                         | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | When bear is aware and unconcerned take the    | 
|                     | opportunity to leave. Do not run.              | 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+ 
| If you hear bear    | Be extremely cautious and leave the area the   | 
| vocalizations or    | way you came.                                  | 
| see young bears in  |                                                | 
| area                |                                                | 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+ 
| If bear approaches  | Stop, stay calm, and assess the situation: is  | 
| you                 | bear acting defensively (grunting, or another  | 
|                     | way?                                           | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Don't run.                                     | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Group together if possible.  Prepare deterrent | 
|                     | (mace).                                        | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Determine if bear is **defensive or            | 
|                     | aggressive.**                                  | 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+ 
| Bear approaching in | **Defensive bears are threatened or may be     | 
| a defensive         | protecting food. They show stressed behaviour  | 
| (stressed) manner   | such as rapid huffing, salivating, roaring,    | 
|                     | paw slapping, guttural noises, open mouthed    | 
|                     | jawing and charging.**                         |

|                     | When bear approaches or charges stand your     | 
|                     | ground (physical contact is rare). Most        | 
|                     | charges stop short.                            | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Appear non-threatening.                        | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Talk to bear in calm voice and let it know you | 
|                     | mean it no harm.                               | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Don't shout or throw things acting             | 
|                     | defensively.  Try to increase distance between | 
|                     | you and the bear (keep your eye on it).  Do    | 
|                     | not run.                                       | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | Use deterrent only as last defense.            | 
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+ 
| In the case of a    | If bear physically contacts you in a defensive | 
| defensive attack    | attack play dead: fall on ground on your       |

|                     | continue to roll over to face.  Stay on ground | 
|                     | till bear leaves.  If attach is prolonged it   | 
|                     | is no longer defensive.                        |

|                     | threaten bear with stick or log.               | 
|                     |                                                | 
|                     | If attacked use deterrent, fight with any      | 
|                     | weapon available with all your strength.       | 
|                     | Focus attack on bear's face.                   |
